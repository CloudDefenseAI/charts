Release Notes : 4.8.5

New feature list:
1) CLI Scan Default Branch Option: We have introduced a new option for the CLI scan, allowing users to instantly set a branch as the default. This feature enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the CLI scanning process.
2) Enhanced SCA Results Sorting: In a significant update to our SCA (Software Composition Analysis) feature, vulnerabilities within the same severity level are now sorted based on their exploitability. This new sorting methodology provides a more nuanced and practical view of the vulnerabilities, helping users prioritize their remediation efforts more effectively.

Improvements:
1) Fixed Vulnerability Dashboard Display Issue: We have resolved an issue affecting the proper display of the Vulnerability Dashboard. Users can now expect an accurate and user-friendly interface for monitoring their system's security status.
2) Corrected JS SCA Scan for Yarn Files: Fixed a problem where the JavaScript SCA (Software Composition Analysis) was not functioning correctly during the scanning of yarn files. This correction ensures more accurate and reliable vulnerability detection in JavaScript projects using yarn.
3) Updated Dependency Search in GoLang: The dependency search mechanism in GoLang has been updated, significantly speeding up the scanning process. This improvement enhances the performance and efficiency of GoLang scans, reducing the time and resources required for comprehensive security assessments.
